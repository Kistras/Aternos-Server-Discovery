# Aternos Server Discovery

## What is this?
This is a javascript program that scans range of ports on range of IP adresses and checks whether there is a minecraft server hosted at this exact location.
## Why is it needed?
This way you can connect to servers (primary Aternos, but can be used anywhere else) that could be otherwise inaccessible/unlisted.
## Are you raiding those servers?
No.
## Then why are you doing this?
To prove that hosting server on Aternos isn't as secure as it's believed.
## Installation?
1. Dump this thing anywhere and run `npm i`.
2. Create your 'config.json' file and fill it accordingly. Look at `config_example.json` for reference.
3. ???
